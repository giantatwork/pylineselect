# PyLineSelect

PyLineSelect is a Visual Studio Code extension that helps Python developers quickly select entire code blocks by simply placing the cursor at the start or within a block of code. Running the command on an existing selection expands the selection and this can be repeated. Just try it out!
This is especially useful when refactoring or analyzing code, as it eliminates the need for manually selecting a block line by line.
Tip: bind the command to &#x2325;+L (Alt-L).

## How to Install

1. Download and install the extension via the Visual Studio Code marketplace or from source.
2. Once installed, activate the extension via the command palette.
